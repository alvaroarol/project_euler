<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br />
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br />
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

<script>

var currentStep = 2;
var previousStep = 1;
var evenSum = 0;

while(currentStep <= 4000000){

    if(currentStep % 2 === 0){

        evenSum += currentStep;

    }

    var bufferStep = currentStep;

    currentStep += previousStep;
    previousStep = bufferStep;

}


//Solution goes here
document.querySelectorAll('span')[0].innerHTML = evenSum;

</script>
